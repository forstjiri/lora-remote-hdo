**WIP**
Remote HDO (relay) toggle, will include wiring in Fritzing, 3D model for case and arduino code for transmitter (tx) and receiver (rx).

**Needed hardware:**
- Ai-Thinker RA-02 SX1278 433MHz (or some other LoRa module)
- Arduino running on 3v3 (some d1 mini, esp 32 dev board, pro micro)
- Relay module
- 433Mhz antena and pigtal to SMA Female cable reduction

**Optional hw:**
- NeoPixel WS2812 RGB led to indicate two-way communication


Compile, upload and monitor with Platformio using make:
```bash
make tx
make rx
```
